# Register schema lock

[`hackuta-2026-register`](../../hackuta-2026-register) **does not push** to Convex. This repo deploys `standing-manatee-425` and production.

Every path listed in **Register-owned (immutable)** below is frozen at the byte level. CI and `npm run convex:push-dev` fail if you edit them without running `npm run register-schema-lock:refresh`.

**Canonical register reference:** [`../../hackuta-2026-register/convex/schema.ts`](../../hackuta-2026-register/convex/schema.ts)

**Frozen snapshots in this repo:**

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`../scripts/register-schema-lock/manifest.json`](../scripts/register-schema-lock/manifest.json) | SHA-256 hash per locked code file (67 `.ts` / `.csv` paths) |
| [`../scripts/register-schema-lock/schema.reference.ts`](../scripts/register-schema-lock/schema.reference.ts) | Copy of register `convex/schema.ts` for schema-body checks |

---

## Admin-owned (editable)

These paths are **not** in the lock manifest. You may add or change them freely.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`schema.ts`](schema.ts) | See [Schema tables](#schema-tables) — only `applicationReviews` and `admins` blocks |
| [`admin/`](admin/) | Organizer Convex queries, mutations, actions |
| [`../src/`](../src/) | Admin dashboard UI |
| [`../scripts/`](../scripts/) | Admin tooling (except frozen register snapshots under `register-schema-lock/`) |
| [`../shared/admin/`](../shared/admin/) | **Future admin-only shared code** — not register-owned |
| [`README.md`](README.md), [`REGISTER_SCHEMA.md`](REGISTER_SCHEMA.md) | Documentation |
| Any `**/README.md` under `convex/` or `shared/` | Directory docs (admin-maintained; not hash-locked) |
| `convex/_generated/` | Local Convex codegen (gitignored) |

---

## Schema tables

File: [`convex/schema.ts`](schema.ts)

| Table / spread | Owner | Editable in admin? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...authTables` | Register | **No** — must match register reference |
| `users` | Register | **No** |
| `eventConfig` | Register | **No** |
| `applications` | Register | **No** |
| `applicationReviews` | Admin | **Yes** — only register-origin table you may change |
| `applicationSubmissionLogs` | Register | **No** |
| `rateLimits` | Register | **No** |
| `resumeUploadSessions` | Register | **No** |
| `emailDeliveries` | Register | **No** |
| `emailDeliveryRecordingFailures` | Register | **No** |
| `admins` | Admin | **Yes** — does not exist in register repo |

All register-owned blocks must remain identical to [`schema.reference.ts`](../scripts/register-schema-lock/schema.reference.ts) aside from the `applicationReviews` section.

## Adding files under `shared/` in the future

| Scenario | Where it goes | Lock behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration feature (bugfix, new applicant field, etc.) | `hackuta-2026-register/shared/…` first | Run `npm run register-schema-lock:refresh` — file is copied into admin and added to `manifest.json` as **register-owned immutable** |
| Admin-only helper (organizer UI, review tooling) | **`shared/admin/…`** in this repo | **Not locked** — never edit register paths; keep admin code separate |
| Accidental new file under `shared/auth/`, `shared/registration/`, etc. | — | `verify:register-schema-lock` **fails** until you refresh from register or move the file to `shared/admin/` |

**Rule:** If it ships registration behavior, it belongs in register and enters the lock via refresh. If it is organizer-only, use `shared/admin/` (or `convex/admin/`).

---

## Updating the frozen copy from register

When register source changes (rare — register does not deploy):

```bash
# hackuta-2026-admin, sibling register repo at ../hackuta-2026-register
npm run register-schema-lock:refresh
npm run verify:register-schema-lock
git add scripts/register-schema-lock/ convex/ shared/
git commit -m "chore: refresh register schema lock from register"
```

Refresh copies changed register files into admin, rewrites `manifest.json` and `schema.reference.ts`, and updates `registerSchemaLockedHash`.

**Never** hand-edit register-owned paths to “sync” — that bypasses the hash check and breaks the contract with register.

---

## Verification commands

| Command | When |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify:register-schema-lock` | Local dev, CI — hash + schema-body check |
| `npm run convex:push-dev` | Auto-runs verify via `preconvex:push-dev` |
| `npm run register-schema-lock:refresh` | After register upstream changes; updates manifest + this doc’s file list indirectly via manifest |

If verification fails with `Locked file changed: …`, you edited a register-owned file.

If verification fails with `Untracked shared file not in lock manifest: …`, add the file via register + refresh, or move it to `shared/admin/`.
